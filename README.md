#Welcome weary traveller <br />
    It seems you are confused, allow me to explain. This is ChessHelper, a <br />badly-written, barely working Chrome extension designed to help/cheat in Chess. It <br />injects js into chess websites (so far only chess.com) which can read & write <br />to their HTML. This is open-source & free so use however you want (don't <br />forget to accredit!)(Not that I could do anything if you didn't)<br />

#What it does<br />
    So far, it just highlights player & enemy pieces as green and red respectively<br />
    Adding more features though!<br />

##Run <br />
    1. Download this & unzip<br />
    2. To run: go to manage extensions (chrome://extensions/)<br />
    3. Enable developer tools on the top right<br />
    4. Click on load-unpacked in top-left<br />
    5. In opened Explorer menu, select this folder<br />
    6. Enable and reload<br />

###Contribute<br />
    I would greatly appreciate if you contribute to this project, all help is welcome &<br /> appreciated! Anything can be contributed, but there's a BUGS.md & TODO.md <br />file for some direction

####Disclaimer<br />
    I am not affilliated in any way to any chess website, including Chess.com<br />
    This could be potentially detected by websites, so use at your own risk<br />
    I also suggest to use as a tool to learn & improve in chess, don't ruin player's <br />days, but do whatever you want

#####Note
    - I am an unexperienced developer, this is my first cheat.<br />
        I don't know programmer notation so some stuff may be confusing.<br />
        But I'm learning and will improve :)<br />
    - This has only been tested for Chrome on Windows<br />
    - This will not auto update, to update, remove extension and follow RUN instructions <br />again
