#Welcome weary traveller
    It seems you are confused, allow me to explain. This is ChessHelper, a badly-written, barely working Chrome extension designed to help/cheat in Chess. It injects js into chess websites (so far only chess.com) which can read & write to their HTML. This is open-source & free so use however you want (don't forget to accredit!)(Not that I could do anything if you didn't)
#What it does
    So far, it just highlights player & enemy pieces as green and red respectively
    Adding more features though!
##Run 
    1. Download this & unzip
    2. To run: go to manage extensions (chrome://extensions/)
    3. Enable developer tools on the top righr
    4. Click on load-unpacked in top-left
    5. In opened Explorer menu, select this folder
    6. Enable and reload
###Contribute
    I would greatly appreciate if you contribute to this project, all help is welcome & appreciated! Anything can be contributed, but there's a BUGS.md & TODO.md file for some direction
####Disclaimer
    I am not affilliated in any way to any chess website, including Chess.com
    This could be potentially detected by websites, so use at your own risk
    I also suggest to use as a tool to learn & improve in chess, don't ruin player's days, but do whatever you want
#####Note
    - I am an unexperienced developer, this is my first cheat.
        I don't know programmer notation so some stuff may be confusing.
        But I'm learning and will improve :)
    - This has only been tested for Chrome on Windows
    - This will not auto update, to update, remove extension and follow RUN instructions again
